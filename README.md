## Before running program
Create a database in SSMS with the script. Open the script in SSMS as a query and run it. If it doesn't work - remove everything
before "USE [Lab1SchoolDatabase], and manually create a database with the name "Lab1SchoolDatabase". Then run the script again.

Make sure to check the connection string in the code if the program can't find the database.
